# Petstore
This is a practical project for backend automation. I wrote it in java and used RestAssured framework. All tests are stored in the class PetStore.java. You must have JDK 19 version to run and check it. You should run the "main" method.
The API of the last test is not working correctly. At some point, it returns the wrong status code, so the last test may fail. It depends on the backend.
